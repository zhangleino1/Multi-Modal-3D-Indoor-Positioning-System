# Project Name: **Multi-Modal 3D Positioning System (M3DPS)**

## Introduction

**Multi-Modal 3D Positioning System (M3DPS)** is an advanced positioning system that leverages Bluetooth Beacons, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR), and visual information to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. This project aims to create a robust and reliable positioning solution suitable for various applications such as indoor navigation, asset tracking, and more.

## Architecture

The system architecture is composed of several components:

1. **Client**: Developed using `uniapp` for cross-platform compatibility.
2. **Backend Positioning Engine and Algorithms**: Implemented in `Python` to handle the core positioning calculations.
3. **Business System**: Managed with `Java` using `ruoyi-vue-pro` framework for seamless business logic integration.
4. **Big Data Visualization**: Utilizes `goview` for creating comprehensive BI dashboards.
5. **Message Queue**: Uses `emqx` for efficient message handling and communication between components.

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combines Bluetooth Beacon signals, PDR, and visual data for enhanced accuracy.
- **3D Localization**: Provides precise three-dimensional positioning.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Ensures real-time updates and positioning information.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to be scalable and adaptable to different environments and requirements.
